Description: command-line tool to find duplicate files and folders
 Defol (deduplicate folders) is a command-line tool that helps you
 find duplicate files and folders. It is heavily inspired by rdfind,
 producing similar output, and treating the first folder given in the
 path as the reference folder.
 .
 Main features:
  - Fully parallelized: uses all available CPU cores for comparison
  - Lazy loading: only reads files to be compared when necessary
  - Smart comparison: uses file size, content, and hash to determine
    duplicates
  - Duplicate folder detection: finds folders with high overlap
  - Safe deletion: can delete duplicates with a dry-run mode
  - Configurable: several options to customize behavior
