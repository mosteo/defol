- [ ] Do not hash soft links
- [ ] Think what to do about soft links
- [ ] Go over identical items increasing their parent overlap
- [ ] List matching folders by amount of overlap
- [ ] Paranoia mode comparing full contents instead of hashes
- [ ] Use LML to report matches in any format
- [ ] When linking against defol as a library (e.g. in tests), it hangs as
  there's no main file that triggers it to start and there are tasks waiting.
  Maybe those should be created by some Init procedure.
- [ ] Dir overlaps are not propagated to parents, so dirs containing other
  identical dirs, will only report partial overlaps. This has somehow to be
  taken into account when tracking overlaps.
- [ ] When tree identical files appear in the same dir, this dir should be a
  100% overlap with itself, not a 150%. The percent should be how much of the
  dir is duplicated info. This will imply somehow keep track of items already
  counted in the dir.
- [ ] Optimize enumeration of dirs, one worker per root instead of current one
  worker per dir. This way accumulated sizes can be obtained recursively rather
  than the current way of going up to the root for every file (which also
  leaves folder names out of the computation, urk)
