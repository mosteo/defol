- [ ] Go over items of same size
  - [ ] Disambiguate if they're the same file
- [ ] Do not hash soft links
- [ ] Think what to do about soft links
- [ ] Go over identical items increasing their parent overlap
- [ ] List matching folders by amount of overlap
- [ ] Ensure initial arguments contain no duplicates
- [ ] Parallelize item matching
- [ ] Paranoia mode comparing full contents instead of hashes
- [ ] Use LML to report matches in any format
- [ ] Maybe have a mode where each file is reported only once (instead of once
  per match), but we have to be careful with concurrency and match kinds. We
  would have to ensure that the file with the smallest ID in the 1st tree is
  consistently reported as the "in_first_tree", and no other identical file in
  the same first tree is reported as "in_first_tree" again. We would need to
  store files with matches somehow and update their kind. Once a file size is
  exhausted, we can report all matches in that size safely.
