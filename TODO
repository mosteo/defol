- [ ] Do not hash soft links
- [ ] Think what to do about soft links
- [ ] Paranoia mode comparing full contents instead of hashes
- [ ] Use LML to report matches in any format
- [ ] When linking against defol as a library (e.g. in tests), it hangs as
  there's no main file that triggers it to start and there are tasks waiting.
  Maybe those should be created by some Init procedure.
- [ ] Dir overlaps are not propagated to parents, so dirs containing other
  identical dirs, will only report partial overlaps. This has somehow to be
  taken into account when tracking overlaps.
- [ ] Optimize enumeration of dirs, one worker per root instead of current one
  worker per dir. This way accumulated sizes can be obtained recursively rather
  than the current way of going up to the root for every file (which also
  leaves folder names out of the computation, urk)
